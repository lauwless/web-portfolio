    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi! I’m Charissa Laurelia, also known as Lauw or Lauwless online.
I’m a creative illustrator based in Salatiga, Indonesia, specializing in anime-inspired artwork. I’m currently studying Visual Communication Design at BINUS @Semarang, where I explore graphic design alongside illustration.
I’m naturally curious and can never seem to stick to just one discipline. My interests often spill into animation, 3D art & animation, programming, game development, writing, and merchandise creation, all of which influence how I approach visual storytelling and design.
Here is where my experiments, ideas, and finished works live. Thanks for stopping by!
